    "there is no state maintained by the network at all. This might not be\n",
    "the behavior we want. Sequence models are central to NLP: they are\n",
    "models where there is some sort of dependence through time between your\n",
    "inputs. The classical example of a sequence model is the Hidden Markov\n",

    "A recurrent neural network is a network that maintains some kind of\n",
    "state. For example, its output could be used as part of the next input,\n",
    "so that information can propogate along as the network passes over the\n",
    "sequence. In the case of an LSTM, for each element in the sequence,\n",
    "there is a corresponding *hidden state* $h_t$, which in principle\n",

    "tensors is important. The first axis is the sequence itself, the second\n",
    "indexes instances in the mini-batch, and the third indexes elements of\n",
    "the input. We haven't discussed mini-batching, so lets just ignore that\n",
    "and assume we will always have just 1 dimension on the second axis. If\n",
